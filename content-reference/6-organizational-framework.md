# ORGANIZATIONAL FRAMEWORK

The I5 Real Estate Delivery Model necessitates a fundamental transformation in organizational structure, moving from traditional silos to integrated, cross-functional teams that leverage digital platforms for seamless collaboration. This section clarifies the organizational setup required for the I5 Model, its implementation, and its steady-state condition, highlighting the benefits of adopting this framework. Central to this transformation is the strategic role of owner-controlled core digital platforms, which serve as the technological backbone for efficient real estate development and continuous improvement.

The I5 Model provides a structured pathway to achieve significant improvements in speed, cost, and quality by embedding productization principles within a collaborative structure that incentivizes continuous improvement. Organizations implementing the I5 Model can realize benefits such as 25-35% faster delivery, 15-25% cost savings, Â±2% cost variance, and 50-70% fewer defects. This organizational framework enables better collaboration, reduces handover errors, accelerates decision-making, and ensures continuity of knowledge throughout the product lifecycle.

## Key Roles in I5 Product Delivery

To support this, organizations should establish dedicated teams organized around specific product lines rather than individual projects, ensuring representation from design, engineering, manufacturing, construction, and customer-facing functions. This structure leads to reduced handover errors between departments, faster decision-making and problem-solving, and continuity of knowledge throughout the product lifecycle via the Body of Knowledge (BoK) platform.

### Core Roles:

- **Product Portfolio Director**: Provides strategic oversight of product lines and market alignment, utilizing aggregated data from owner platforms for strategic decisions.

- **Product Manager**: Leads specific product lines end-to-end, balancing customer needs with technical feasibility. Manages the product lifecycle within owner platforms (BoK, AEC, etc.) and coordinates partner interaction via these platforms.

- **Design Standards Manager**: Develops and maintains standardized design elements and configuration guidelines within the owner's BoK platform, using AEC/DfMA platforms for validation.

- **Manufacturing Integration Lead**: Optimizes designs for factory production and supply chain coordination via owner platforms (DfMA) and partner interfaces. Defines integration requirements for partner manufacturing systems and reviews partner production data fed into owner platforms.

- **Digital Delivery Lead**: Manages the owner's BIM, Virtual Showroom, and other digital platforms; defines partner access protocols. Administers owner platforms (AEC, DfMA, BoK, VS) and oversees integration points.

- **Quality Systems Manager**: Develops and enforces quality standards across design, manufacturing, and assembly using owner's quality systems/platforms. Manages quality data within owner platforms (AEC/Quality) and sets standards for partner quality reporting into owner systems.

- **Site Assembly Manager**: Coordinates on-site module assembly and integration with site-built elements, using the owner's AEC platform for scheduling, progress tracking, and quality reporting.

- **Product Performance Analyst**: Collects and analyzes product performance data (from owner platforms) for continuous improvement. Analyzes data aggregated across owner platforms (AEC, BoK, potentially operational data) to feed improvements into the BoK.
