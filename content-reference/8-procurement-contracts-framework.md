# PROCUREMENT & CONTRACTS FRAMEWORK

This section details the **I5 Real Estate Delivery Model's comprehensive strategies for procurement and contracts**, moving beyond traditional practices to embrace collaborative, value-based approaches that support productization, integration, and long-term partnerships. A central tenet is the explicit structuring of procurement and contracts to reflect the **owner's control over core digital platforms** and the **owner's authority to define requirements for partner-used construction technologies**.

## Overview of I5 Procurement & Contracts Framework

### Introduction to the I5 Procurement & Contracts Framework

Effective procurement and contract strategies are **central to realizing the benefits of the I5 Model**, which transforms traditional, often adversarial, practices into integrated, productized delivery methods. The I5 Model's procurement approach shifts from a narrow focus on lowest initial price to a **strategic, value-based approach** that supports long-term standardization and collaboration.

A core principle is that **core digital platforms are explicitly owned, procured, administered, updated, and controlled by the owner**, who grants appropriate access to partners. The governance of specific construction technologies used by partners is determined by the owner on a case-by-case basis. This ownership model ensures **strategic alignment and intellectual property protection**.

### Key Principles of I5 Procurement

The transition to productized delivery is guided by key principles:

- **Value Definition**: Shifts from focusing on the lowest initial cost to optimizing for **lifecycle value and integration efficiency**
- **Timing**: Emphasizes **early supply chain involvement during product definition**, rather than traditional engagement after design completion
- **Relationship Model**: Fosters **strategic, program-level partnerships** over transactional, project-based relationships
- **Scope Delineation**: Focuses on **integrated scope by functional system or module**, rather than fragmented trade disciplines
- **Risk Allocation**: Promotes **collaborative risk management** across the team instead of transferring risk down the supply chain
- **Performance Measurement**: Measures **contribution to overall project outcomes** rather than mere compliance with specifications
- **Technology Integration**: Mandates **defined requirements for partner interaction with owner platforms** and establishes **owner governance over partner construction technologies**

## Procurement Strategy Development

### Purpose of Procurement Strategy Development

The transition to productized delivery necessitates a fundamental shift in procurement thinkingâ€”from price-focused, project-by-project purchasing to **strategic, value-based procurement** that supports long-term standardization and collaboration within the **context of owner-controlled digital platforms and defined technology governance**.

### Key Principles of I5 Procurement Strategy

To operationalize the principles outlined in the Overview, procurement strategies for I5 implementation should:

- **Align with Product Strategy**: Directly support defined product platforms and standardization objectives, with materials and services selected to enable repeatable solutions (managed in the **BoK platform**)
- **Enable Early Involvement**: Engage key suppliers and manufacturing partners during the product definition phase to incorporate production expertise into the design process (facilitated via **DfMA and AEC platforms**)
- **Support Integration**: Facilitate collaboration between design, manufacturing, and on-site assembly, **leveraging owner platforms for coordination**
- **Create Long-term Value**: Consider the total cost of ownership, including quality, durability, and operational performance
- **Manage Supply Chain Complexity**: Address the growing complexity of supply chain relationships as production shifts off-site, often coordinated via **owner's SCM and AEC platforms**
- **Incorporate Technology Governance**: Include steps to assess **partner digital readiness**, define requirements for **integrating with owner platforms**, and address any **owner-stipulated conditions for partner-used construction technologies**

### Procurement Category Management & Supplier Segmentation

Category management and supplier segmentation ensure an effective supply chain for I5 implementation:

**Procurement Category Structure for I5 Implementation**:

- **Owner Digital Platforms**: **Very High strategic importance**; involves owner-led procurement/development, long-term Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), integration capability, scalability, security, vendor management
- **Design Services**: High strategic importance; requires **DfMA expertise and proficiency with owner platforms (AEC, DfMA, BoK)**
- **Manufacturing Services**: High strategic importance; requires **ability to integrate with owner DfMA/AEC platforms for data exchange**
- **Construction Services**: High strategic importance; requires **ability to use owner AEC platform for coordination** and adherence to owner requirements for site technologies
- **Materials and Components**: Medium to High strategic importance; considers standardization potential, supply stability, and cost volatility
- **Partner Technology Systems**: Variable strategic importance (case-by-case); requires alignment with owner requirements for source, reliability, integration, visibility, and security
- **Logistics Services**: Medium strategic importance; requires **tracking capabilities integrated with owner AEC/SCM platforms**

**Supplier Segmentation for I5 Implementation**:

- **Strategic Partners**: Critical to I5 success; involve **deep integration with owner platforms (AEC, DfMA, SCM, BoK)**, co-development potential, and alignment on technology roadmaps
- **Preferred Suppliers**: Important to operations; require **standardized data exchange with owner platforms** and use of supplier portals
- **Transactional Suppliers**: Standardized offerings with minimal integration required, potentially basic electronic transactions
- **Emerging Partners**: New relationships with strategic potential; may require support for meeting basic integration requirements

## Contract Models and Selection

### Purpose of Contract Models and Selection

Selecting the appropriate contract model is crucial for establishing the legal and commercial framework that defines responsibilities and allocates risk throughout the I5 delivery process. A key requirement is that **contracts must explicitly address the use of owner-controlled platforms and the governance of partner-used technologies**.

### Contract Model Comparison for I5 Implementation

The I5 Model requires contracting approaches that facilitate collaboration, standardization, and parallel activities:

- **Integrated Project Delivery (IPD)**: A multi-party agreement with shared risk/reward, collective governance, and early involvement. Has **Very High technology clause needs**, defining **platform access, data ownership, integration requirements, intellectual property related to platform usage**

- **Design-Build**: A single entity responsible for design and construction. Has **High technology clause needs**, specifying the contractor's use of **owner platforms (AEC, DfMA)**, data submission standards, and conditions for the contractor's construction technology

- **Construction Management at Risk (CMAR)**: CM provides pre-construction services then converts to a General Contractor. Has **Medium-High technology clause needs**, defining the CM and designer's use of **owner platforms**, coordination protocols via platforms

- **Progressive Design-Build**: A two-phase design-build process. Has **High technology clause needs**, requiring clear definition of **platform usage and technology requirements** during the collaborative phase

- **Alliance Contracting**: Owner and key providers work as an integrated team, sharing all risks/rewards. Has **Very High technology clause needs**, requiring **comprehensive technology governance clauses covering platforms, partner technology, data, and integration**

- **Framework Agreement with Works Orders**: A master agreement for multiple projects leveraging standardization. Has **Medium technology clause needs**, where the master agreement defines standard **platform usage terms and integration requirements**

### Contract Model Selection Factors

Selecting the appropriate contract model requires consideration of multiple factors:

- **Project Characteristics**: Including complexity, schedule requirements, design certainty, standardization potential, off-site manufacturing scope, and site constraints
- **Organizational Capabilities**: Such as procurement expertise, contract management experience, **IT capability to manage owner platforms**, and the **capability to define and enforce technology standards**
- **Market Conditions**: Encompassing supply chain maturity for prefabrication, contractor capabilities, **partner digital readiness and capability**, and the regulatory environment
- **Strategic Objectives**: Including schedule acceleration, cost certainty, quality and performance expectations, risk tolerance, long-term relationship development goals, innovation priorities, and the **desired level of technology control**

## Contract Management and Administration

### Purpose of Contract Management and Administration

Collaborative contract administration establishes procedures and practices that support the integrated, team-based approach of the I5 Model while maintaining appropriate accountability and control. This is largely **facilitated by the owner's digital platforms**.

### Collaborative vs. Traditional Contract Administration

The I5 Model requires a collaborative approach to contract administration, founded on:

- **Mutual Accountability**: All parties share responsibility for contract success
- **Transparency**: Open sharing of information **via owner platforms**
- **Proactive Management**: Early identification and resolution of issues **using platform data**
- **Balanced Documentation**: Maintaining appropriate records **within owner platforms** without excessive administration
- **Solution Orientation**: Focus on finding effective solutions rather than assigning blame

### Leveraging Owner Platforms for Contract Management

Effective management of contractual relationships in the I5 framework benefits significantly from the **owner's integrated digital ecosystem**:

- **AEC Platform (Core Functions)**: Serves as a **central repository for contracts**, manages workflows, links contract milestones to schedules, tracks costs, facilitates communication, and generates reports and dashboards
- **Owner SCM/Procurement System**: Manages **supplier contract details, performance history, and compliance information**, generates purchase orders/contracts, and processes invoices
- **Body of Knowledge (BoK) Platform**: Acts as a repository for **approved contract templates and standard clauses**, and stores **lessons learned** on contract effectiveness
- **Virtual Showroom (VS) / CRM**: Links **client choices and agreements to delivery contracts**, ensuring alignment for scope and billing

### Financial and Payment Management

Financial and payment management processes align with the I5 Model's integrated approach, utilizing data and workflows within owner platforms:

- **Payment Approaches for Off-Site Manufacturing**: Include progress payments, milestone payments, advance payment plus completion, material plus value add, and stage payments
- **Financial Security Approaches**: Include off-site materials bonds, vesting certificates, advance payment guarantees, escrow arrangements, and specific insurance coverage for off-site components

### Dispute Prevention and Resolution

Effective dispute management focuses first on prevention through **clear communication and proactive issue resolution**, greatly facilitated by **transparency provided by owner platforms**:

- **Tiered Dispute Resolution Approach**: I5 employs a multi-level approach, from direct negotiation to structured management review, executive review, and structured Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
- **Dispute Prevention Strategies**: Include clear contract documentation, **alignment and communication via platforms**, **early warning systems leveraging platform data**, and **collaborative decision-making facilitated by platforms**

## Managing the Supply Chain Ecosystem

### Purpose of Managing the Supply Chain Ecosystem

Supply chain network design establishes the optimal structure of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and logistics providers to support the I5 Model's productized approach. This design explicitly considers **integration with the owner's digital platforms (SCM, AEC, DfMA)**.

### Supply Chain Network Design

Key elements of supply chain network design in I5 include:

- **Manufacturing Facility Strategy**: Focuses on location decisions, capacity planning, and the level of technology and automation
- **Supplier Network Configuration**: Defines the tier structure, geographic distribution, and redundancy strategies
- **Logistics and Distribution System**: Addresses transportation modes, warehousing, and Just-In-Time (JIT) vs. buffer inventory strategies
- **Information and Planning Systems**: Leverages **owner platforms and integrated partner systems** for demand forecasting, production planning, inventory management, order management, tracking, and performance measurement

### Supplier Development and Management

Effective supplier development actively enhances supplier performance, fosters innovation, and creates a collaborative ecosystem supporting the I5 Model. This explicitly includes the supplier's **ability to integrate digitally with the owner's ecosystem**.

### Parallel Off-Site and On-Site Management

Parallel off-site and on-site management establishes processes and tools (**primarily owner platforms like AEC**) to coordinate manufacturing activities with site construction, ensuring smooth integration of prefabricated components with site-built elements.

### Logistics and Just-In-Time (JIT) Delivery

Integrated logistics management ensures that materials, components, and modules flow efficiently from suppliers through manufacturing to the construction site, with minimal inventory and JIT delivery. This is **coordinated via owner platforms and integrated partner systems**.

The procurement and contracts framework provides the foundation for successful collaborative relationships that enable the I5 Model's benefits to be fully realized.
