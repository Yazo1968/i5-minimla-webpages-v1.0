# FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK

This section outlines the **I5 Real Estate Delivery Model's comprehensive financial framework**, providing a structured approach to investment planning, cost analysis, and return projections. This framework is specifically designed to reflect the unique characteristics of productized real estate delivery, ensuring financial viability and optimizing value across the entire asset lifecycle.

## Overview of I5 Financial Framework

### Introduction to the I5 Financial Framework

The I5 Model requires a **structured approach to investment planning, cost analysis, and return projections** that differs significantly from traditional methods. This framework provides practical guidance for establishing a robust financial foundation that supports productized real estate delivery, specifically **accounting for the owner's investment in core digital platforms** like the Body of Knowledge (BoK), Virtual Showroom (VS), Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA), and Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) platforms, as well as their associated operational costs.

### Key Differences from Traditional Financial Frameworks

The I5 Model's financial framework presents several key distinctions compared to conventional industry approaches:

- **Owner Digital Platform Investment:** Unlike traditional models with minimal or no platform investment, I5 involves **significant upfront and ongoing investment** in owner-controlled digital platforms for their procurement, creation, customization, integration, administration, maintenance, and updates. These costs are often **amortized across a portfolio or programs**, rather than per project.

- **Design & Engineering Costs:** Traditional approaches have sequential design and engineering costs, typically 3-5% of total project cost. In the I5 Model, these costs are **front-loaded and higher (5-7%)** due to increased initial investment to enable standardization and Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA), with these design costs then **amortized across multiple projects**.

- **Shift to Off-site Manufacturing:** I5 significantly shifts a portion of construction costs (25-35%) to factory production of standardized components in partner facilities. This contrasts with minimal or no off-site manufacturing in traditional models.

- **Reduced On-site Construction:** On-site costs are reduced to 35-45% of the total, focusing primarily on assembly and integration rather than raw material construction.

- **Lower Contingency:** Due to reduced variability from standardization, the I5 Model typically requires a **lower contingency (3-5%)** compared to the 5-10% seen in traditional methods, although technology-related risks must still be considered.

- **Compressed Financing Costs:** Shorter delivery cycles lead to **reduced financing costs (3-6%)** through faster project completion.

- **Integrated Cost Management:** Cost management focuses on coordination between factory and site, and supply chain integration, extensively **leveraging owner platforms**.

### Benefits of the I5 Financial Framework

The I5 Model delivers significant value through various mechanisms that are captured in its Return on Investment (ROI) calculations:

- **Schedule Compression:** Achieves **20-50% timeline reduction** and **1-3% cost savings** from reduced financing costs through parallel processing and off-site manufacturing.

- **Quality Improvement:** Leads to **60-70% reduction in defects** and **1-2% savings in warranty costs** due to controlled manufacturing environments and standardized designs.

- **Cost Efficiency:** Provides **10-20% direct cost savings** across multiple projects through material waste reduction, labor productivity improvements, economies of scale, and reduced design costs via reuse.

- **Sustainability Enhancement:** Results in **30-40% waste reduction** and **20-30% embodied carbon reduction** through optimized design and factory production.

- **Scalability Benefits:** Enables **40-50% increase in delivery capacity** with the same resources by supporting the delivery of multiple projects with consistent quality and predictable outcomes.

- **Platform Efficiency Gains:** Investing in and utilizing the owner-controlled BoK, VS, DfMA, and AEC platforms leads to **improved collaboration, reduced errors, faster decision-making, and better knowledge management**.

## Cost Structure and Drivers

### Cost Structure Comparison: Traditional vs. I5 Model

| Cost Category | Traditional Approach | I5 Model Approach | Key Differences |
|---|---|---|---|
| Land Acquisition | 20-30% of total cost | 20-30% of total cost | Similar proportion, but site selection may prioritize standardization compatibility |
| **Owner Digital Platform Investment** | Minimal or none | **Significant upfront & ongoing investment** (varies) | **New cost category**: Includes procurement/creation, customization, integration, administration, maintenance, and updates for BoK, VS, DfMA, AEC platforms |
| Design & Engineering | 3-5% of total cost, mostly sequential | 5-7% of total cost, **front-loaded** with higher initial investment | Increased upfront design investment to enable standardization and DfMA; design costs amortized across multiple projects |
| Off-site Manufacturing | Minimal or none | **25-35% of construction cost** | Significant shift to factory production of standardized components; controlled environment reduces waste and improves quality |
| On-site Construction | 60-70% of total cost, primarily on-site labor & materials | **35-45% of total cost**, focused on assembly and integration | Reduced on-site labor; shift to component assembly rather than raw material construction |
| Project Management | 3-5% of total cost, traditional management | 3-5% of total cost, integration management | Focus shifts to coordination between factory and site, supply chain integration, leveraging owner platforms |
| Marketing & Sales | 3-7% of total cost, traditional marketing | 3-7% of total cost, product-centered marketing | Emphasis on standardized product benefits, leveraging owner's Virtual Showroom platform |
| Contingency | 5-10% of construction cost, risk-based | **3-5% of construction cost**, reduced due to standardization | Lower variability in standardized approaches reduces risk contingency requirements |
| Financing | 5-8% of total cost, duration-based | **3-6% of total cost**, compressed timelines | Shorter delivery cycles reduce financing costs through faster completion |
