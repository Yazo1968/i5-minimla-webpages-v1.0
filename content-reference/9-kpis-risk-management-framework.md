# KPIs & RISK FRAMEWORK

This section details the systems and processes for performance monitoring and risk management within the I5 Real Estate Delivery Model. It outlines how to measure success, mitigate risks, and drive continuous improvement, all underpinned by the owner-controlled digital platforms.

## Overview of I5 KPIs & Risk Framework

### Introduction to the I5 KPIs & Risk Framework

The I5 Real Estate Delivery Model's success hinges on robust **performance monitoring and proactive risk management**. This framework provides **data-driven decision-making** throughout the project lifecycle, offering **early warning signals** for potential issues and quantifiable evidence of improvement over time.

A core aspect is the continuous monitoring of **owner-controlled digital platforms** and the management of risks associated with both these platforms and **partner-used construction technologies**. This approach ensures resilience against challenges and demonstrates the value of the I5 approach to stakeholders.

### Integration with Other I5 Frameworks

The KPIs & Risk Framework is deeply integrated with other core I5 frameworks, operating as a cohesive system:

- **Delivery Framework**: Project performance is continually monitored using a comprehensive set of Operational, Financial, and Strategic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) throughout all five sequential phases of the I5 Delivery Framework. Risk management is an embedded and ongoing process across all project phases.

- **Operational Ecosystem**: The **owner-controlled digital platforms** (BoK, VS, DfMA, AEC) are fundamental enablers for collecting and analyzing performance data, providing holistic visibility and supporting continuous improvement.

- **Organizational Framework**: The roles and responsibilities defined within the Organizational Framework directly influence how performance is tracked and how risks are mitigated, particularly concerning **platform administration and usage**.

- **Financial Framework**: The comprehensive set of KPIs is crucial for **financial assessment**, and **risk management** places a particular emphasis on **technology-related risks** associated with the digital platforms and their financial implications.

- **Procurement & Contracts Framework**: Contracts include **specific cybersecurity requirements and liability clauses** related to the security of data transferred and integrated systems. Contractual risk allocation explicitly addresses **technology risks related to owner platforms and partner technologies**.

| **Schedule Risk** | Contractor (LDs) | **Shared (milestone incentives)** | Milestone-based incentives with shared responsibility |
| **Quality Risk** | Contractor (owner inspection) | **Shared quality management system** | Qualified product definitions; Joint verification protocols |
| **Technology Risk** | Often unaddressed | **Owner (for core platforms); Partner (for their tech); Shared (for integration failures)** | **Clauses defining platform SLAs, access terms, security requirements, liability for integration failures** |

### Cybersecurity & Digital Risk Management
